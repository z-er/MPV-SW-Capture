## 📋 Features

- **Play any console HDMI‑compatible console** through your USB capture card using MPV.
- **Minimal lag/latency** – play your real console with lag almost as low as connecting it directly to a TV.
- **Portable** – copy the whole folder anywhere and it will work without reinstallation.
- **Custom menu** (right‑click or `ESC`) with:
  - **Shaders** – improve image quality up to 4K or apply retro looks (CRT, VHS, Arcade, etc.).
  - **Shapes** – change the screen geometry (curvature, keystone, etc.).
  - **Crop** – crop the window to the exact size of an NSO system (GBA, NES, SNES, etc.).
  - **Bezels** – overlay decorative borders (e.g., SNES NSO bezel) for an authentic feel.
  - **Window options** – resize, reposition, always on top, and more.
  - **Screenshots** – automatically save screenshots to your MPV folder.
  - **Video recording** – record 30/60/90/120 second clips with good quality and small file size.
- **Fully customizable** – add your own bezels, shaders, and menu entries.

## ⚙️ How it works (minimal lag/latency)

MPV alone can introduce noticeable latency when handling both audio and video from a capture card.  
This setup **splits the workload**:

- **MPV** handles the video stream only.
- **`ffplay`** (from the ffmpeg bundle) handles the audio stream only.

Both programs run silently, stay in sync, and together deliver minimal‑lag gameplay with audio and video.

### Native MPV audio for streaming

The **Audio** menu also offers **MPV Native (Discord/Stream)**. This makes MPV open both the capture card video and audio device, so Discord, OBS, and similar application-audio capture features can pick up MPV-SW-Capture directly. Select it, then restart MPV-SW-Capture for the change to take effect. Switch back to **FFplay Low Latency** for the original lowest-latency audio path.

## 📦 Requirements

- A PC with **USB 3.0** (USB 2.0 works but performance will be noticeably worse).
- A capture card that supports **1080p60** and provides loop‑through (input + output) – e.g., “4K Ultra HD USB 3.0 HD Video Capture (MS 2131)” or any similar device.
- Your own official video game console.
- **mpv player** and **ffmpeg/ffplay** (see note below).

> **✨ Note on dependencies:**  
> While this project does not bundle mpv or ffmpeg/ffplay due to licensing and size constraints, the included **`Installer_MPV-SW-Capture.exe`** tool can download and place the correct versions automatically.  
> For most users, this is the simplest way to get started.  
> If you prefer, you can also obtain them manually from their official sources:
> - [mpv (zhongfly builds)](https://github.com/zhongfly/mpv-winbuild/releases)
> - [ffmpeg (gyan.dev Essentials)](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)
